# Project Management Tool - The Planning Phase

## About The Series

This is the first post in a behind the scenes series where we take you from start to finish of a production application designed by the Midway Web Develoment team. We will start the series off with the most important phase in any project, the planning phase. After that we will walk through our design, development and the marketing phases of the project.

## Outline

- The Planning Phase
- Determing The Purpose
- Develop The User Story
- Project Manager Stories
- Team Member Stories
- Determine MVP

## The Planning Phase

The planning phase is one of the most crucial parts to any web project yet it is often glossed over. With proper planning you can identify the scope of the project and lay out an effecient road map to getting your app online. You should never start developing until you are satisfied with your plan.

Proper planning ensures the project:

- Stays on schedule
- Stays within budget
- Encorporates the necessary features
- Meets the needs of the user
- Fits the companies branding
- Does not include unnesccesary features(we will get into this more when we talk about the MVP)

## Determine The Purpose

The first step is identifying what the problem that your web app is set out to takle. This should be a solution that solves a specific problem. The purpose of our application will be:

**Our team needs a tool to track projects by urgency, status and deadlines as well as have the ability to assign tasks to members of our team.**

It is best to have a specific purpose for you app so that you can make a general assumption right of the bat about the scope, requirements and needs of the project. Also, having a clear purpose helps to ensure that the project stays on track.

## Develop The User Story

At MWD we use an agile approach of identifying the project requirements by looking at it from the perspective of the end user. We can do this by creating a "conversation" about a users needs and how they would accomplish those tasks.

Once we have identified the user story we can use them to plan our development sprints. This step should not get into any technical language or technologies, remember it is from the perspective of the user.
The user story consists mostly of two elements, epics and stories. Stories are smaller in scope and can be individual tasks that contribute and make up an epic. Stories should usually take a week or two to complete.

We use the common description template of:

### User Story Template

**AS A** _TYPE OF USER_ **I WANT** _SOME GOAL_ **SO THAT** _SOME REASON_

This will get placed on cards(physical or digital) so that they can be visually laid out and discussed amongst the team.

Our example application epics will be:

**Epic 1:** AS A project manager I WANT to create a project board SO THAT i can create and manage tasks involved with the project to stay on timeline and manage workloads.

**Epic 2:** AS A team member I WANT to be able to see tasks associated with a project SO THAT i can determine my work requirements.

Once we have our epics we can identify the stories or _subtasks_ that make up our epics.

### Epic 1 Project Manager Stories

AS A project manager I WANT to initiate a project board

AS A project manager I WANT to assign team members to the project

AS A project manager I WANT to add tasks to the project

AS A project manager I WANT to add dues dates to tasks

AS A project manager I WANT to add priorities to the tasks

AS A project manager I WANT to add track time spent on a task

AS A project manager I WANT to see the status of a task

### Epic 2 Team Member Stories

AS A team member I WANT TO to view all tasks

AS A team member I WANT TO add time spent on a task

AS A team member I WANT TO change the status of a task

AS A team member I WANT TO add tasks to the project

AS A team member I WANT TO estimate time required to complete the task

As you can see we have broken our epics down into smaller digestable tasks that can be easily distributed among a team

## The MVP

The MVP is the "minimal viable product". The MVP is the least amount of development you can do to get your product in front of users while still providing a service. By doing this you can start getting user feedback immediately. Getting early user feedback means that you will minimize time wasted on unwanted or uneeded features that maybe you thought the user wanted. Also, once your MVP is launched you can determine if the interest in your app is worth continuing on with development whether your app better suits another market or to just cut your losses and ditch the project.

------------ IN PROGRESS(CANT THINK OF THE WORDS OR IT NEEDS MORE RESEARCH) -----------

There are many other planning stategies or things to consider when planning a web project that are not covered here. This is a 1 mile overview of a planning strategy.

Some other planning things to look into are Market Research Budget breakdown

  The second post will go over the design phase of the application.

  The third part will go over the backend development phase of the project.

  The fourth part will go over the front end development phase of the project.

  The fifth and final phase will go over the deployment and marketing phase of the project

  ## Why Is Planning Important

  Planning identifies the problem at hand. You can not confidently take on a project if you do not first fully understand what the project is for.

  The process itself is just as important as ending up with a beautiful end result. Ask the designer: -->
