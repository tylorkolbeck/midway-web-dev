## About The Series

This is the first post in a behind the scenes series where we take you from start to finish of a production application designed by the Midway Web Development team. We will start the series off with the most important phase in any project, the planning phase. After that, we will walk through our design, development, and marketing phases of the project.

## The Planning Phase

The planning phase is one of the most crucial parts of any web project and should never be taken lightly. With the proper planning, you can identify the scope of the project and layout an efficient road map to getting your app online. Development should never start until you are satisfied with your plan.

### Proper planning ensures that the project:

-Stays on schedule
-Stays within budget
-Incorporates the necessary features
-Meets the needs of the user
-Fits the companies branding
-Does not include unnecessary features(we will get into this more when we talk about the MVP)

## Determine The Purpose

The first step is identifying the problem that you want the web app to solve. It should be something that solves a specific problem. The requirement for our app will be:

**Our team needs a tool to track projects by urgency, status, and deadlines as well as can assign tasks to members of our team.**

It is best to have a specific purpose for your app so that you can make a general assumption about the scope, requirements, and needs of the project. Having a clear purpose also helps to ensure that the project stays on track because you will be working to solve the specific problem that you are making the app for in the first place.

## Develop The User Story

At MWD we use an agile approach of identifying the project requirements by looking at it from the perspective of the end-user. We can do this by creating a "conversation" about a user's needs and how they would accomplish those tasks.

Once we have identified the user story we can use them to plan our development sprints. This step should not get into any technical language or technologies because it is from the perspective of the user.

The user story is generally broken into two categories; top-level epics and lower-level stories. Epics are an overall goal that is made up of stories. The stories are smaller in scope and can be individual tasks that contribute to accomplishing the task identified in an epic. Stories are usually short enough that they can be developed in a week or two.

### User Story Template

All user stories follow a similar pattern and can be plugged into the following template:

**AS A** _TYPE OF USER_ **I WANT** _SOME GOAL_ **SO THAT** _SOME REASON_

Our example application epics will be:

**Epic 1:** AS A project manager I WANT to create a project board SO THAT I can create and manage tasks involved with the project to stay on the timeline and manage workloads.

**Epic 2:** AS A team member I WANT to be able to see tasks associated with a project SO THAT i can determine my work requirements.

These epics will get placed on cards(physical or digital) so that they can be visually laid out and discussed amongst the team. More specific stories are identified and placed under each epic.

### Epic 1 Project Manager Stories

**AS A project manager I WANT to create a project board SO THAT I can create and manage tasks involved with the project to stay on the timeline and manage workloads.**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AS A project manager I WANT to initiate a project board

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AS A project manager I WANT to assign team members to the project

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AS A project manager I WANT to add tasks to the project

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AS A project manager I WANT to add due dates to tasks

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AS A project manager I WANT to add priorities to the tasks

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AS A project manager I WANT to track time spent on tasks

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AS A project manager I WANT to see the status of a task

### Epic 2 Team Member Stories

**AS A team member I WANT to be able to see tasks associated with a project SO THAT i can determine my work requirements.**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AS A team member I WANT TO to view all tasks

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AS A team member I WANT TO add time spent on a task

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AS A team member I WANT TO change the status of a task

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AS A team member I WANT TO add tasks to the project

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AS A team member I WANT TO estimate time required to complete the task

As you can see we have broken our epics down into smaller digestible tasks that can be easily distributed amongst a team.

## The MVP

With the purpose and user stories identified the next step is to determine the projects MVP or "Minimal Viable Product".

The MVP is the least amount of development you can do to get your product in front of users while still providing a service. By doing this you can start getting user feedback immediately. Getting early user feedback means that you will minimize time wasted on unwanted or unneeded features that maybe you thought the user wanted.

Once your MVP is launched you can determine if the interest in your app is worth continuing with development whether your app better suits another market or to just discontinue.

## Identify The Tech Stack

With all of our planning pieces, we have a good idea of the scope and requirements of the project. Looking at the project we can start to determine the best technologies to use which would fit the product. These will include choosing front end frameworks and backend tools such as databases and servers.

## Part 2 coming soon...

In the next behind the scenes post, we will start the branding and design phase of the project.
